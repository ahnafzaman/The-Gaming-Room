# The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
For this project, our client The Gaming Room wanted us to develop a web-based game application based on their legacy application Draw It or Lose It which was only available as an Android application. The goal of the project was to broaden compatibility across multiple platforms. The game is loosely based on 1980’s TV game show Win, Lose Or Draw. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I have put a lot of focus on clarity and covering all client requirements. I believe I have clearly outlined and translated all the requirements into technical specifications ensuring all aspects of the application was thoroughly documented paying special attention to compatibility, design and user experience as per the client’s vision.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document is extremely helpful in developing the code as it provides a plan and gives structure to the entire process. It serves as a point of reference for the requirements and serves as a roadmap keeping me on track until the completion of the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had a chance to revise my work, I would put in a little more work in the Evaluation section. While I had addressed most of the major points, I believe a little more research and comprehensive exploration would enhance the document’s robustness.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Deciphering client needs was crucial in outlining the design document. Understanding the client's vision, their target audience and their expectations helped me create a thorough document addressing all the requirements. Focusing on client needs helped guarantee that the result would be successful.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach to designing software involved a combination of understanding the client's requirements, conducting lots of research about different platforms and operating systems, and utilizing iterative design techniques. My focus was on following the client’s vision while providing the best ideas and approaches to turn the vision into reality. In the future, I plan to further enhance the process by exploring and keeping myself updated with trends and latest tools and technology to design a similar software application.
